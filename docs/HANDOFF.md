# HANDOFF — foundation review checkpoint

Date: 2026-09-20. Local branch: `master` (`96e2a1e` + uncommitted review fixes).
Remote: `origin/main` (`c8930e1`, README only). No merge, no push yet.

## Completed work

- Minimal Expo SDK 54.0.37 / RN 0.81.5 / React 19.1.0 / expo-router 6.0.24 app
  with one Home screen; web preview supported; native-only code isolated in
  `mobile/lib/*.native.ts`; call button labelled SIMULATED throughout.
- Minimal FastAPI app (`GET /health`, `GET /v1/status`) with local-preview
  CORS (GET only, no wildcard); 3 pytest tests.
- Fixes this round: aligned `babel-preset-expo` (~54.0.10, was wrongly 14.0.6)
  and `react-native` (0.81.5) via `npx expo install --fix`; added backend CORS
  after browser inspection proved the web preview couldn't reach the API;
  corrected README on bundled-JDK Gradle use; kept Expo-generated
  `tsconfig.json`/`mobile/.gitignore` additions.
- LiveKit `1.2.12` import verified on Python 3.13 in `backend/.venv` only;
  not in committed requirements.

## Verification evidence

- `pytest backend/tests -q`: 3 passed (also reproduced in a fresh venv from
  committed instructions only; freeze identical; temp env removed).
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: exit 0. `npx expo-doctor`: 18/18.
- `npx expo export --platform web`: 3 static routes.
- Playwright browser inspection of `http://localhost:8081/` (backend live):
  Home renders, `Backend: ok (0.0.1-foundation)`, button toggles to
  `End simulated call` / `SIMULATED CALL ACTIVE (UI state only)`,
  0 console errors (1 framework `pointerEvents` deprecation warning).

## Untested

- Android build: UNTESTED (no Studio/SDK/adb on this machine).
- Physical device: UNTESTED (no device, no voice implemented).
- Interactive check command for the owner: run backend + `cd mobile`,
  `npx expo start --web --port 8081`, open `http://localhost:8081/`.

## Blockers / notes

- Dev servers stopped after inspection; ports 8000/8081 free. Other running
  servers (port 8082, Bookconnect) belong to other work — untouched.
- One broad `Stop-Process` on `python.exe` was used mid-task; future kills
  must target PIDs/command lines only.
- Supabase: new project `zyjylsvh…` clean (0 tables); old `ahntbtkt…`
  disabled in opencode config. No migrations run or planned this milestone.
- OpenCode version on record: 1.14.33. No global permission changes made.

## Next action

Owner approves the review-branch procedure (merge `master` onto `main` via a
`review/foundation` branch, resolve README deliberately, push branch only),
then pilot setup begins with EAS cloud development builds.
